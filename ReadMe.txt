Terms & Conditions (N.N.N. Neural Network Nexus Pre-Alpha V.0.1)

Clarification:
1. "We", "Us", or "Our" refers to the developers of N.N.N 
2. "Product" refers to N.N.N unless stated otherwise.
3. "You" refers to the user (users) of our product.
(Non-capitalized versions are included.)

Section 0, Important!:
	The user automatically agrees to terms and conditions when they use any versions of our product (N.N.N.). We will not be held responsible if you didn't read a certain part of the terms and conditions.

Section 1, Usage:
	We allow the usage of our product completely for free; however, if done so, you will need to credit us or at the very minimum credit "N.N.N."
	If you don't use the code of the product for testing or inspiration, then you're not obligated to credit us. 

Section 2, Data & Privacy:
	The data saved during use is manual; we do not save any data without the user's consent. The user is free to clear their local saved data at anytime.
	The user is free to share any data (from the store.txt file) containing the parameters of the nodes online.
	We do not have direct access to your data (from your use of our product); any data of yours that may be online is not our responsibility.

Section 3, Modification:
	We openly allow the user to modify the downloaded code on their device and use it as a foundation for their own projects (as stated in Section 1, credit is due).
	We will not be held responsible for any damage you may inflict on your own device (or on yourself if that's even possible) if you choose to modify the code.

Section 4, This doesn't have a solid legal ground:
	We just want credit where it's due, that's all! Use our product however you like.
